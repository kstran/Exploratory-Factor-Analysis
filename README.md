# Exploratory Factor Analysis

## Description 
This research project is dedicated to the structure of scales measuring at-titudes towards mathematics in Japan.  As a general result, I found out how these questions  split  into  factors,  and  how  they  affect  the  academic  achievement. 

## Data 
[TIMSS  2015  data](http://timss2015.org/timss-2015/about-timss-2015/).
A total of 4,745 responses were received from students from Japan. I used 29 variables to answer the research questions, each of which is listed in the table below. For further convenience in the interpretation of the results, the variables have been renamed. The main variable that will subsequently be predicted is “BSMMAT01” or “success”, which is responsible for the student’s academic performance.

## Technologies and methods used
+ The project was executed in the R language
+ Hypotheses and their verification using visualization and key statistical indicators
+ Using advanced data visualization
+ Factor analysis, Regression analysis explaining math achievement
+ Libraries: dplyr, knitr, psych, ggplot2, car, summarytools
